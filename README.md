My inaugural React project: a personal portfolio built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. This hands-on practice features a custom dark/light mode toggle, responsive design, and sections for services, projects, and contact. A showcase of my learning journey in React, Flutter, and full-stack development.
